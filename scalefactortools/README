## all the scale factors for efficiency will be saved here, with a function to provide the number which will be used as weight in the analysis

## user need not know all details, just make sure the rootfiles used for the SF are correct, before using them blindly.

## the code to extract and numbers is validated but the rootfile must be checked time to time with POG recomendation

## add all the .root files in the directory data and in the readme, mention the links from where the SFs rootfile were downloaded.
